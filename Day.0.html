		<h1>Journey of Code</h1>

		<p><h2><u>Day 0 (FEBRUARY 23, 2016)</u></h2></p>

		<p> This is a self-project for myself that displays my progress as I self-learn web-development, hoping to also inspire myself and others to learn to code.
		</p>

		<h2><u>How This All Started</u></h2>
		<p> I major in Computer Engineering (a marriage of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I've taken loads of Math courses, Physics, a few programming courses, and even an electrical engineering course. Although I am academic, I've never learned how to make websites (a skill that is highly valued today). </p>

		<p>And as a Computer Engineering student, I feel a need to learn everything I can about computers, even web development. Moreover, I have always been looking for a project to make.However, I never had any ideas for a website that I would like to make. No inspiration. Then it hit me.</p>		
		

		<p>
			"Why not make a website that shows people how I learn, including the nitty-gritty details, web-development?"
		</p>

		<p>
			Not only would I be more motivated by seeing myself make progress, but I would also be showing to people through my self-learning, that despite how <em>LEARNING CODE MIGHT BE INTIMIDATING . . . </em><strong>ANYONE CAN LEARN!</strong>

		<p><h2><u> What's Gonna Go Down</h2></u></p>
		<p> Through this project, I will be following a schedule; I will be coding 1 hr everyday, and will be blogging my progress through my website (which is non-existant as I am writing this) regularly, showing what I learned, my challenges, and my progress.
